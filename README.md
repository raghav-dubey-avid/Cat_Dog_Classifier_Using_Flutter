# cat_dog_classifier

This project involved developing a Flutter application designed to accurately classify images as either cats or dogs. Leveraging the robust capabilities of deep learning, the application was integrated with TensorFlow to process and analyze extensive datasets of animal images. To facilitate effective machine learning operations, various specialized libraries were utilized, enabling seamless interaction with the datasets.

A key feature of this application is its high classification accuracy, exceeding 90%. This was achieved through meticulous model training and optimization, ensuring that the system could reliably differentiate between cats and dogs with a high degree of precision.

The application’s architecture was carefully crafted to support real-time image processing, allowing users to upload pictures and receive instant classification results. The seamless integration of Flutter and TensorFlow technologies underscores the application’s innovative approach to combining mobile development with advanced machine learning frameworks.

Below are screenshots that demonstrate the application’s user interface and showcase its classification capabilities in action:
